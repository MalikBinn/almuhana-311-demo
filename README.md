I am not so familiar with the Marx Brothers movies. However, after I read about
 them I most likely prefer Groucho to be my favourite Marx. This because he was
 extremely intelligent and was able to be successful whether among the brothers
 and alone aswell. Furthermore, he is one of the few funny persons in the history
 of America.
